# Smart Parking System – IoT Project

A full-stack IoT-based Smart Parking System that integrates embedded hardware, cloud database, and mobile application to provide a real-time solution for managing parking slots.

> This project was developed as part of a university course and showcases end-to-end integration of IoT hardware, backend automation, and mobile app development.

## Mobile App – Flutter

The Flutter app allows users to:

- View available parking slots in real-time  
- Book/reserve slots via Firebase Realtime Database  
- Receive feedback on parking status (occupied, empty)

**Tech used:** Flutter, Dart, Firebase

### To Run:

```bash
cd iot/flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

> You will need your own `google-services.json` to connect to Firebase.

## Node-RED Flow

- Reads sensor data from ESP8266 (IR and RFID)
- Controls servo motor for gate operation
- Updates Firebase Realtime Database with spot status and reservation details
- Receives data via HTTP POST from ESP8266 modules

**File:** [`node_red_smartparking_final.json`](iot/node_red_smartparking_final.json)

### To Use:

1. Open Node-RED  
2. Import the JSON flow  
3. Deploy and test with HTTP requests from your device

---

## Firebase Realtime Database

Used to store:

- Current spot status (occupied/empty)  
- Vehicle RFID and time in/out  
- User reservations and booking times

**File:** [`firebase_smartparking_final.json`](iot/firebase_smartparking_final.json)

### Structure Sample:

```json
{
  "spots": {
    "A1": {
      "status": "occupied",
      "rfid_actual": "1234567890",
      "time_in_actual": "2025-07-15 08:00",
      "time_out_actual": null
    }
  },
  "reservations": {
    "user_uid": {
      "spot_id": "A1",
      "start_time": "...",
      "end_time": "..."
    }
  }
}
```
